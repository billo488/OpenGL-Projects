This project serves to track my progress with the free educational resources provided by "Learn OpenGL".
I will upload any and all projects provided in the reading that I may follow.

*NOTE TO SELF: Do not use the phrase "using namespace std;" for simplifying the use of cout and cin.
This is bad practice, with the main reason that two libraries can have the same function name,
thus leading to errors. Instead, it is better to manually declare this information
by using "std::cout" or "std::cin"*

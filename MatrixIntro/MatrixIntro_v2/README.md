For v2, added matrix and transformation functionality. The box will now be translated by (0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f) and rotate every frame in relation the current time using (float)glfwGetTime().

Also, enabled wireframe to better view triangles and better understand the translation process as the box moves.

Currently no textures are implemented.

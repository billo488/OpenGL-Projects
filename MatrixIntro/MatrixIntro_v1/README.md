This version will create an unoptimized cube using 36 vertices (as opposed to an optimized cube, which would utilize 8 vertices). There are 12 triangles that are drawn - 2 on each face of the cube.
Each triangle is made up of 3 vertices, thus:

Verts = Triangles * 3 = 36

The resulting cube will show as an orange 2D rectangle. The next step will be to apply textures and perform a transformation/rotation so we can view the 3D elements.
